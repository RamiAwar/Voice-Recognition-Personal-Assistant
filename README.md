# Voice-Recognition-Personal-Assistant
A small terminal-based mac and raspberry pi personal assistant I made to make queries, listen to music, and download music using voice commands. Very useful and simple to use.

##main.sh
This is the script that links everything together. First a speech to text python script is run, which converts whatever is spoken to text. After that depending on what the first word of your phrase is, another script is run. For now the keywords are:

####Play: Plays the first youtube video found about whatever you say after the word play.

####Download: Downloads the first youtube video found depending on what you asked, and downloads it as a high quality webm file which is afterwards converted to mp3 using ffmpeg.

####Sleep: Breaks out of the main loop and kills the script.

####Anything else: Gets processed as a query using Wolfram Alpha to get meaningful results to nearly any practical question.

In the end when a query result is returned, a text to speech script runs, which converts the result of your query to speech generated by google translate's natural sounding synthesizer.
